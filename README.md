# ArchA
A simplistic tampermonkey script that sends a highlighted piece of text to a helper site<br>
There are three different versions of Arch-A<br>
> [Simplistic](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/462354-arch-a)<br>

This is the version that will be included with the default greasyfork download<br>

> AI<br>

In this version you use the power of Chat GPT<br>

> Custom<br>

In this version it sends to a custom api<br>

## Helper Docs<br>

### Simplistic<br>
Just install it and it will work!<br>

### AI<br>
* replace <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN> with your OpenAI API authentication token<br>
* replace <OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT> with the endpoint of the OpenAI GPT API.<br>

> If you are using an older browser that does not support the fetch API, you may need to use an alternative method to make the request.<br>

### Custom<br>
Figure it out...<br>
Only thing you should have to replace is the `runArchA()` function<br>

I will not provide any support.
